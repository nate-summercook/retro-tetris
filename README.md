# Retro Tetris

One day I felt a bit nostalgic and wanted to imitate Spectrum Holobyte's version of Tetris from back in 1987.
As a kid I used to play this game a lot on our Macintosh computer and it bothered me that I didn't have a way to still play this today ðŸ˜….

It's built with React (create-react-app) and Redux.

The music is the original music from back in the day. The images are mimicking the topics of the original version (couldn't find the original pictures anymore).
